## request
Develop a Cyber Security News webpage using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL and put it onto the remote webserver. 
It should include three articles: Malware(100 words), Ransomware(100 words), approaches to Password Cracking(200 words). 
The article content can be used from any source (provide a URL as a reference in the article). 
Readers should be able to comment on the news article. Readers can also read comments from other users. 

The web application should be dynamic with the following technical requirements: 
• Clear use of HTML5 tags including text, images, and links
• Use of a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap, to provide a responsive layout 
• Use of a custom CSS to demonstrate any element 
• Use of CSS transition or CSS Animation or Canvas Animation 
• Use of PHP server-side script(s) to enable: 
  - reading a table in a database – view old comments 
  - writing to a table in a database – post new comments

The web application should have a professional look with the following characteristics: 
• Attractive layout, colour, and use of images 
• Good contrast between the background and text 
• Clear functionality from the user’s perspective 
• Purposeful interactive elements which enhance the appearance and functionality of the application
  The web application should not have large areas of empty space or oversized graphics. 
  The web application should not have pointless use of interactivity e.g., mouseover logo to show a larger logo. 
 
## analysis
The inputs to the project are the following:
- Content from cyber security news websites
  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-chrome-extensions-with-75m-installs-removed-from-web-store/
  https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/06/the-2023-state-of-ransomware-in-education-84-increase-in-known-attacks-over-6-month-period?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=linkedin
  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/top-5-password-cracking-techniques-used-by-hackers/
- Optimized images
- Provided server space on the Abertay student web server to host a website
- Registered profile on the LinkedIn social network

The progressive enhancement technique is applied while building the website. More advanced features are added when the basic site is developed. The application takes the user to the Home page with an image gallery where images and their descriptions are used as links to the three cyber security articles. Each link goes to the separate page with an article content and illustrations. Proper HTML semantic and non-semantic tags are applied. CSS and Bootstrap framework are used to style and make pages responsive. The website opened on mobile device looks good, the user gets the same experience as on the desktop. Each Article page has a form with a built-in validation for adding comments, and a list of previous comments. The user can provide their name and leave a comment to the chosen article. Comments are stored in a database. There is a navigation menu with an internal link to the home page and a footer with an external link to the social network profile.

The web site is hosted on the Abertay Mayar server - http://mayar.abertay.ac.uk/~2208417/blog. 
The user interface provides the meaningful interaction functionality without empty spaces, oversized graphics or pointles use of communication between the website and the user.
The nice appearance is achieved by considering the consumers expectations, using video and images, chosing the qualitative content, appliying attractive colors and appropriate typography. However, the whole user interface design is kept simple.

## design
The web application architecture:
Client: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

There are four pages on the website. The sitemap is: 
Home page                       First page                 Second page                Third page
 
Website Title                   Article1                   Article2                   Article3 
Statement about the site        Form for the comment       Form for the comment       Form for the comment
Image galary with links         Previous comments list     Previous comments list     Previous comments list

The Home page contains information about the website and links to the articles. The links are organized with <div> blocks. Each block contains an image and a description.
The image acts as a link. To make the whole <div> block clickable the following technique is used: inside the link an empty <span> tag is set, the block is given position:relative, 
the span is given position:absolute, width:100% and height:100%. Each article page displays the content, collects data from user, validates, and sends it to the server to store in the database. The previous comments are retrieved from the database and listed below the form.
Bootstrap’s production-ready CSS and JavaScript is included via CDN, basic global display, typography, and link styles are set, more control is added with components......., form, ...
The grid system with media queries are used to make the layout responsive. The official framework documentation is clear and comprehensive.

Server: Apache HTTP server, PHP, MySQL
Responds to the requests and sends an HTML document to the browser. Processes the user's data, stores and loads it from the database. MySQL database system is used for the data persistence. It provides control and flexibility. The comments are stored in three tables, one for each article.
