                        <h3>IBM has officially entered the generative AI arena</h3>
                        More than a decade after debuting Watson — a literal question-answering machine designed to beat humans at “Jeopardy” — 
                        IBM is renewing its push into artificial intelligence. The company has brought back the brand in the form of Watsonx, 
                        a platform that aims to help companies create and integrate custom AI capabilities into their operations. CEO Arvind Krishna says 
                        the new data and AI platform could replace between 30% and 50% of “repetitive, back-office processes” in coming years and has repeatedly 
                        emphasized its accuracy compared with rival AI products. <span id="more">...read more</span>

                        <h3>IBM's CEO says nearly 8,000 jobs at the company could be replaced by AI</h3>
                        IBM will wait and see which jobs can be replaced by artificial intelligence before hiring for more back-office roles. 
                        Roughly 7,800 jobs in departments such as human resources could be done with AI and automation, CEO Arvind Krishna says. 
                        The century-old company, which has about 260,000 employees, continues to hire for customer-facing roles and software development. 
                        Still, Krishna's announcement is one of the most sweeping by a major corporation on the impact of the new technology on its workforce, Bloomberg notes.
